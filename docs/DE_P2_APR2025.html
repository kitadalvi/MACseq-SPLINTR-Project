reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<p>Next, we can look the differentially expressed genes by visualising
the voom-transformed counts of the treated and DMSO samples in a
heatmap, to make sure that the DEgenes we’ve identified actually look
“different” in terms of their expression.</p>
