Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<div id="qc-and-filter-barcodes" class="section level2">
<h2>QC and filter barcodes</h2>
<p>To assess quality of data, we can look at the number of barcodes
detected per cell and the number of UMIs supporting the most frequent
barcode:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotBarcodesPerCell(counts)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/Untitled.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotUmiPerBarcode(counts)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/Untitled.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In order to find suitable threshold for filtering, we can plot
cumulative sum of how many cells would pass each threshold:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotUmiFilterThresholds(counts)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/Untitled.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We can also filter by removing minor barcodes from cells. A minor
barcode is defined as a barcode that has less than half the number of
supporting UMIs than the major barcode in the cell:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>counts_filtered &lt;- filterBarcodes(counts, umiCountFilter = 25, umiFractionFilter = 0.5)

plotBarcodesPerCell(counts_filtered)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/Untitled.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
As any given well will have multiple barcodes, we can aggregare barcodes
per well by concatenating barcodes and UMIs with ‘;’ :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>counts_agg &lt;- aggregateBarcodes(counts)
head(counts_agg) </code></pre>
