Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it
difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine.
Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/kitadalvi/MACseq-SPLINTR-Project/tree/cbf5e6f33e75709424ebce18740657259cc50aaa" target="_blank">cbf5e6f</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    data/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    data/DEgenes/
    Ignored:    data/enrichedPathways/
    Ignored:    data/rObjects/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  analysis/Untitled.Rmd
    Untracked:  analysis/org38_SPLINTR.Rmd

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/DGE_VPathwaysEnrichment.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/_site.yml

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were
made to the R Markdown
(<code>analysis/differential_expression_24H.Rmd</code>) and HTML
(<code>docs/differential_expression_24H.html</code>) files. If you’ve
configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>),
click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they
were in that past version.
